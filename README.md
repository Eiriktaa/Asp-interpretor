# Asp-interpretor
- A showcase of an interpretor project that was given as the final exam in the course IN2030 @ UIO
- The code cannot be displayed in a public repository because it is still part of a running course, but any interested party can inquire to see more of the code :)



## Assignment
The assignement was a 4 part project spanning the entire semester to create an interpretor for a python-like language. The language ASP is a barebones version of python containing most of the basline functionalites of the language. The compiler itself is written in Java.

Part 1: Scanner
- This part of the project had us handle the the input of the source file. It tokenizes the source file and saves it in a syntax tree for the parser to handle

Part 2: Parser
- The parser uses recursive decent to parse the syntax tree and figures out if the code is valid.

Part 3/4: Runtime
- The compiler had to handle the various variables and their respective operations. The compiler should be able to handle all the operations/function calls/assignments that is part of the language
